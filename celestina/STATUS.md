# Celestina status

- **Updated:** 2026-08-04
- **Implementation:** R0-R4 complete; no checkpoint is active
- **Author validation:** mixed; see [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md)
- **Live migration:** Noctalia still supplies every responsibility not yet
  explicitly handed over by the author

## Current checkout truth

- A C++20/Qt 6.9+ host maps one top layer-shell panel per output and owns the
  `org.celestina.Shell1` session interface.
- Rust helpers reduce Niri state and carry the aggregate providers through the
  pure `celestina-shell-core` contracts.
- The panel contains real workspace/window, system, media, audio, DDC and tray
  state. It can become the StatusNotifierWatcher when no other process owns it.
- The launcher and clipboard-history overlays are implemented and use the same
  surface and command contracts.
- Typed volume, mute and brightness session verbs enter through
  `org.celestina.Shell1`, reach their provider and are answered `pending` and
  then `confirmed` or `failed` from a later reading, never from acceptance.
- A corner on-screen display shows volume, microphone and per-monitor
  brightness. It is raised by what a provider published, never by a request, so
  a key that changed nothing raises nothing; it never takes focus or the
  keyboard.
- Night light and the idle inhibitor are held states: the helper owns the
  `wlsunset` and `systemd-inhibit` child that holds each one, notices it dying,
  and releases both before it exits. Neither turns itself on.
- `displays-off` is composed through Niri, whose own answer is the outcome.
- `lock` and `lock-and-suspend` are refused: no locker provider exists while
  SHELL-D1 is open, and a shell that cannot lock says so instead of reporting
  success. The provider seam is the refusal site.
- The optional Niri bindings, the tool each verb needs and the rollback are in
  [README.md](README.md). Nothing applies them: the shell never edits a Niri
  configuration, and deleting the block is the whole rollback.
- No task document authorizes changing Niri configuration, installing a locker,
  activating the shell or stopping Noctalia.

- Toasts appear in the top-right corner and never take focus; the notification
  centre — the panel's unread indicator, or
  `celestina msg notifications-toggle` — is the keyboard path to every action a
  toast offers. The on-screen display moved low and centred so a volume key
  cannot paint over a notification.
- The aggregate helper can be the session's `org.freedesktop.Notifications`
  server, but claims the name only when it is free. Noctalia owns it today, so
  the provider withdraws and the panel shows nothing rather than the shell
  taking notifications away from a running server.

## Durable boundaries

`celestina-shell-core` owns pure protocol and policy. Rust helpers own bounded
non-Qt IO. C++ owns Qt, D-Bus and layer-surface adaptation that CXX-Qt cannot
express cleanly. QML owns presentation only. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and the
suite [architecture standard](../docs/standards/architecture.md).

## Evidence boundary

The canonical release bundle was built and verified on 2026-08-03: Rust tests,
direct QML lint, CTest 11/11, an eight-second offscreen smoke of the release host
with the compiled style module, and dynamic-library checks passed. Exact
artifacts, commands and limits are recorded in the suite
[evidence](../docs/evidence/2026-08-03-repository-governance.md). This does not
replace any real Niri check in [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md).

R3 ran its registered exit end to end on 2026-08-04: `complete-production.sh`
built the 0.2.0 bundle once, verified those exact bytes — Rust checks, QML lint,
CTest 13/13 and an eight-second offscreen smoke — and deployed them to the
author's normal test prefix under `~/.local`. The live session was not replaced
and no service, package manager or configuration was touched. The record is
[the R3 completion evidence](docs/evidence/2026-08-04-r3-completion.md).
