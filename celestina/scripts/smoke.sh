# Celestina smoke (design §8): with niri installed, a nested niri runs the
# shell for four seconds with `--metrics` (`dev-session.sh --once`, on a
# session bus of its own so no name of the desktop's bus is touched), and the
# run must exit 0, draw at least one frame on the nested `winit` output,
# report its late frames, and draw no frame at rest (`rest_frames=0`: no
# frame while nothing animated, after the first second). Inside the same nest
# `smoke-notify.sh` sends one Notify (long body, one second timeout) to the
# shell's server on the nest's own bus; the shell must answer with an id and
# raise the banners' surface, and the banner is gone again before the run
# ends. A second nested run then opens the launcher with `celestina launcher
# toggle`, keeps it open for three seconds (the nest answers an idle client
# about once a second), closes it the same way, and must still exit 0 with
# both toggles logged and a frame drawn on the launcher's surface. Without
# niri the nested session is skipped with a notice; without busctl and gdbus
# the notification part is.
